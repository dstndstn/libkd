  @brief    Test a floating-point variable for NaN value.
  @param    n   Number to test (float or double)
  @return   1 if n is NaN, 0 else.

  This macro is needed to support both float and double variables
  as input parameter. It checks on the size of the input variable
  to branch to the float or double version.

  Portability is an issue for this function which is present on
  most Unixes but not all, under various libraries (C lib on BSD,
  Math lib on Linux, sunmath on Solaris, ...). Integrating the
  code for this function makes qfits independent from any math
  library.

  to branch to the float or double version.

  Portability is an issue for this function which is missing on most
  Unixes. Most of the time, another function called finite() is
  offered to perform the opposite task, but it is not consistent
  among platforms and found in various libraries. Integrating the
  code for this function makes qfits independent from any math
  library.
